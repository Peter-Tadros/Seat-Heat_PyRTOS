Seat-Heat PyRTOS
This project implements a seat heating system using PyRTOS, a real-time operating system in Python.

Overview
The seat heating system is designed to manage and control the temperature of a car seat, ensuring comfort for the occupant. The system utilizes PyRTOS to handle real-time tasks such as temperature monitoring, user input processing, and heater control.

Features
Temperature Monitoring: Continuously reads the seat temperature to maintain it within a desired range.
User Input Handling: Allows users to set their preferred seat temperature.
Heater Control: Activates or deactivates the heating element based on the current and desired temperatures.
Files
Seat-Heat-PyRTOS.py: Contains the main implementation of the seat heating system using PyRTOS.
Lab_design.pdf: Provides detailed design documentation for the system.
Requirements
Python 3.x
PyRTOS library
