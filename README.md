# Seat-Heat PyRTOS

This project implements a seat heating system using PyRTOS, a real-time operating system in Python.

## Overview

The seat heating system is designed to manage and control the temperature of a car seat, ensuring comfort for the occupant. The system utilizes PyRTOS to handle real-time tasks such as temperature monitoring, user input processing, and heater control.

## Features

- **Temperature Monitoring**: Continuously reads the seat temperature to maintain it within a desired range.
- **User Input Handling**: Allows users to set their preferred seat temperature.
- **Heater Control**: Activates or deactivates the heating element based on the current and desired temperatures.

## Files

- `Seat-Heat-PyRTOS.py`: Contains the main implementation of the seat heating system using PyRTOS.
- `Lab_design.pdf`: Provides detailed design documentation for the system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyRTOS library

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Peter-Tadros/Seat-Heat_PyRTOS.git
   cd Seat-Heat_PyRTOS
   pip install pyRTOS

2. Run the main script to start the seat heating system simulation:
```bash
  Code kopieren
  python Seat-Heat-PyRTOS.py

```
